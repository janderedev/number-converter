# What is this?

This is a simple program which converts numbers between different number systems (e.g. hex to binary).

I had to do this manually for the last 2 weeks in school, and I was bored so I decided to automate it.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./num-converter
Usage: ./num-converter [Input number] [Input type] [Output type]
Input and output type can be any of "hex", "dec", "oct", "bin" or any number from 2 to 16.
Example: ./num-converter DCEF hex bin
```

## Download

Download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/janderedev/number-converter/releases) on GitHub, or build it yourself using `cargo build --release`.
