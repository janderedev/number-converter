# What is this?

This is a simple program which converts numbers between different number systems (e.g. hex to binary).

I had to do this manually for the last 2 weeks in school, and I was bored so I decided to automate it.

## Usage

```bash
./num-converter --help
```

## Download

Download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/janderedev/number-converter/releases) on GitHub, or build it yourself using `cargo build --release`.
